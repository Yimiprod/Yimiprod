# ðŸŽ¼ Let's ROCK ðŸ¤˜


```rockstar
The Universe says Hi Stranger
Tranquility is destination
Listen to the stars
The Light says New Friend

If the stars ain't gone
Put the stars into the light

The Sun is too antediluvian
The Moon is your fate
Burn the sun

Shatter the Universe with the sun
Let the Universe at Tranquility be the light
Burn the moon
Unite the Universe with the sun

The Darkness says Nice to meet you
Whisper the Universe with the moon
Shout "My name is Cesar"
Whisper the Darkness
Say "You can call me Yimi"
```

## Who am i

I'm a french full-stack Javascript developer, I've worked on various projects, from high traffic sites to smaller scale web apps, as well as more R&D oriented projects such as desktop and mobile applications using web technologies.
Been there, done that, always learning new things and love to share and talk about any tech subjects.
